# Build a Simple Circuit

The following circuit diagram turn on an LED when power is applied.

A light emitting diode (LED) will light up when above a minimum voltage is applied and several milliamps flow through. For most small, indicator type LEDs, the minimum voltage is about 1.7V and 5mA makes the LED nice and visible. More than 10mA and the LED will get hot and possible start to smoke. Current can flow through the LED in one way, in the direction of the arrow. If the LED is inserted backwards it will not light! This type of component is called polarized, since it only works one way. Most polarized components have a long leg and a short leg, where the longer leg is the more positive side, to indicate how to plug it in.

A resistor follows Ohm's Law, V = I * R. If would be difficult to make the exact voltage the LED requires to turn on the LED, so a larger voltage is applied, the LED uses up what it needs to turn on, and the remaining volage ends up across the resistor. In this way the current through the circuit is controlled by using Ohm's Law with the remaining voltage to select a resistor to generate the required current. Resistors are not polarized, so they can be plugged in either way. Resistors have color bands to indicate their value, or a multimeter in resistance mode can be used to read the value.

Values are read with the gold band on the right, as [color1 color2 * 10 to the color3]. FOr example, brown black orange gold is 1 0 * 10^3, or 10k Ohms.
